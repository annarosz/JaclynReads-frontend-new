# Project Description:

## Problem definition / purpose

Our Application is a custom product for Jaclyn Crupi.

Jaclyn is a book reviewer and book seller and this App is a place for her to collect her reviews with the added functionality of users being able to purchase the book upon reading the review (as well as other features). Our App creates a direct connection between both sides of her professional life â€“ reviewing and selling books. 

Jaclyn told us about a prominent use case, where people often read her reviews on mobile while browsing in a bookshop to determine which book to buy, therefore it was important to optimise the App for mobile use.

Jaclyn reads and reviews approximately 200 new release books every year so our App had to have the ability to sort data into different categories and have the ability to scale into the future. 

Jaclyn has a popular Instagram account where she posts her reviews so it was important for us to add extra value for Jaclyn when designing and building this App.
